LinkedIn Caption (Professional & Project-Focused):
âœ… Day 5 â€“ Experimental Engine complete!

I built a system to test how the same synthetic individual responds to different treatments like vaccine boosts, stress, or sleep deprivation â€” just like digital trials used in biotech.

It runs immune simulations for every treatment and records changes in:

Immune strength (0.0 to 1.0)

Outcome classification (Strong / Moderate / Weak)

CSV-ready results for ML training or visual dashboards

Proud of this milestone! Day 6 next: ðŸ§  visualization + streamlit dashboard.
