# SimLab: In-Silico Immune System Experiments

SimLab is a Python-based simulation engine for immune system modeling. It enables reproducible, keyboard-driven experiments using synthetic populations varied by age, sex, race, and medical history.

## Features
- Generate synthetic biological populations
- Simulate immune responses to treatments
- Run repeated experiments
- Analyze outcomes with ML models
- Optional dashboard for visualization

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Python modules
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter development files
- `data/`: Synthetic and processed datasets
- `results/`: Simulation outputs
- `app/`: Streamlit dashboard (optional)

## Getting Started
pip install -r requirements.txt





 Day 2 ‚Äì Synthetic Population Generator

Python-based population generator that uses the public **[Random User API](https://randomuser.me)** to fetch realistic user profiles, and enriches them with:

- **Race/Ethnicity** (randomized from a list)
- **Medical history** (mocked conditions)
- **Immune baseline scores** (random float between 0.3 and 1.0)
- **Profile picture URL** (realistic image link from API)

The result is a rich, diverse, synthetic population that mimics real-world data across demographic and health factors.

###  Example Output Fields

| full_name | age | sex | race_ethnicity | email | location | medical_history | immune_baseline | image_url |
|-----------|-----|-----|----------------|-------|----------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Jane Doe  | 34  | female | Asian | jane@example.com | Tokyo, Japan | Asthma | 0.78 | `https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/84.jpg` |


 How to Run:
 python -m src.main



  Day 3 ‚Äì Immune System Simulation (B/T Cell Model)
Built a simulation engine that models how each synthetic individual responds to infection using a simplified version of real-world immune response logic.

Each individual‚Äôs response is based on:

Immune baseline score

Age-related immune decline

Medical history (e.g. immunodeficiency, cancer)

The model computes:

B-cell response (antibody production)

T-cell response (cell-mediated immunity)

Immune strength score (0.0 to 1.0)

Outcome classification (Strong, Moderate, Weak)

üî¨ Example Output Fields (added to CSV)
immune_baseline	b_cell_response	t_cell_response	immune_strength	outcome
0.82	0.79	0.61	0.7	Moderate

‚öôÔ∏è Code Location
Core logic: src/immune_model.py

Simulation applied in: src/main.py



Testing
I use pytest to ensure the immune system simulation code works correctly and reliably.

What is tested?
Correct output fields from the immune response simulation

Immune strength values are within expected bounds (0 to 1)

Proper classification of immune response outcomes (Strong, Moderate, Weak)

B-cell and T-cell response values within plausible ranges

How to run tests
pip install pytest
Run tests from the project root directory:
